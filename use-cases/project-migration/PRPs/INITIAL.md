# Project Migration - Initial Requirements

## Overview

Migrate an existing project to use Context Engineering principles and practices without disrupting current development workflows. This involves analyzing the existing codebase, extracting knowledge and patterns, and gradually implementing context engineering practices alongside existing development.

## Target Project Details

**Example: React + Node.js E-commerce Platform**
- **Frontend**: React 18 with TypeScript, Redux Toolkit, Tailwind CSS
- **Backend**: Node.js with Express, PostgreSQL, JWT authentication
- **Infrastructure**: Docker, AWS deployment, GitHub Actions CI/CD
- **Team Size**: 5-8 developers
- **Current Pain Points**: Inconsistent patterns, poor documentation, slow onboarding

## Core Migration Requirements

### Analysis and Discovery

- **Authentication**: Passport.js and JWT implementation patterns
- **Database Layer**: Sequelize ORM patterns and query optimization
- **Error Handling**: Centralized error handling and logging
- **Security Patterns**: Input validation, rate limiting, CORS configuration

### Infrastructure Migration
- **Docker Configuration**: Container setup and multi-stage builds
- **AWS Deployment**: ECS/Lambda deployment patterns
- **CI/CD Pipeline**: GitHub Actions workflow optimization
- **Environment Management**: Configuration and secrets management
- **Monitoring**: Application performance and error tracking

## Expected Outcomes and Success Metrics

### Immediate Benefits (Week 1-2)
- **Complete Project Analysis**: Technology stack, dependencies, and architecture documented
- **Migration Strategy**: Detailed roadmap with phases and timelines
- **Initial PRPs**: 2-3 high-impact features converted to PRP format
- **Team Buy-in**: Developer enthusiasm for context engineering approach

### Short-term Goals (Month 1)
- **Development Velocity**: 25-35% improvement in feature development time
- **Documentation Coverage**: 60%+ of major features have comprehensive PRPs
- **Team Adoption**: 80%+ of team members actively using context engineering
- **Knowledge Capture**: Critical tribal knowledge documented and accessible

### Long-term Vision (Quarter 1)
- **Full Integration**: Context engineering standard practice for all new features
- **Measurable ROI**: Quantified improvement in development efficiency and code quality
- **Team Excellence**: Team becomes context engineering advocates and champions
- **Sustainable Practice**: Self-reinforcing context engineering culture established

## Migration Constraints and Considerations

### Technical Constraints
