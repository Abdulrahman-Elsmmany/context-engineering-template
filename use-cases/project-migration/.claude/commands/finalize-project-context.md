# Finalize Project Context - Create Customized CLAUDE.md

You are a senior context engineering specialist who creates the final, definitive CLAUDE.md file for ANY project after completing all migration phases. Your task is to analyze the completed migration, extract lessons learned, and create a project-specific CLAUDE.md that reflects the actual patterns, technologies, and practices discovered during the migration process, regardless of the project's technology stack or domain.

## Finalization Objectives

Create a comprehensive, project-specific CLAUDE.md that replaces the generic migration template:

1. **Technology Stack Integration** - Document actual detected technologies and patterns
2. **Domain-Specific Rules** - Include industry/domain-specific considerations (healthcare, fintech, etc.)
3. **Proven Pattern Documentation** - Include patterns validated during migration phases
4. **Team Workflow Integration** - Document how context engineering integrates with actual team practices
5. **Quality Standards** - Establish project-specific quality criteria based on migration experience

## Step 1: Migration Completion Analysis

Analyze the completed migration to understand what was actually built:

```bash
# Review migration completion status
Read "PRPs/migration/phase-4-completion-report.md" || Read "MIGRATION_PROGRESS_VALIDATION_REPORT.md"

# Review all created PRPs to understand actual patterns
LS "PRPs/"
Read "PRPs/ai_docs/knowledge_extraction_summary.md"

# Check technology-specific documentation created
LS "PRPs/ai_docs/"
Read "PRPs/ai_docs/nextjs_development_guide.md" || Read "PRPs/ai_docs/react_development_guide.md"
Read "PRPs/ai_docs/patterns/frontend_patterns.md"
Read "PRPs/ai_docs/security/security_patterns.md"
```

## Step 2: Project Technology Stack Analysis

Analyze the actual project structure to understand the real technology stack:

```bash
# Analyze package.json for frontend technologies
Read "package.json"

# Check for backend technologies
Read "firebase/functions/package.json" || Read "server/package.json" || Read "api/package.json"

# Identify database and infrastructure
Glob "**/{firebase.json,docker-compose.yml,serverless.yml,vercel.json}"

# Check for specific frameworks and libraries
Grep "next\|react\|vue\|angular" package.json
Grep "express\|fastify\|koa" --type=js,ts
Grep "firebase\|supabase\|aws\|gcp" --type=js,ts,json
```

### Technology Detection Results
Based on analysis, identify:

```markdown
## Detected Technology Stack

### Frontend
- **Framework**: [Next.js 14/React 18/Vue 3/Angular/etc.]
- **Language**: [TypeScript/JavaScript]
- **State Management**: [Redux/Zustand/Context/etc.]
- **Styling**: [Tailwind/CSS Modules/Styled Components/etc.]
- **UI Components**: [shadcn/ui/Material-UI/Ant Design/etc.]

### Backend
- **Runtime**: [Node.js/Python/Java/Go/etc.]
- **Framework**: [Express/Fastify/Django/Spring/etc.]

- **Monitoring**: [Sentry/DataDog/etc.]
```

## Step 3: Domain-Specific Pattern Analysis

Analyze the project domain and industry-specific requirements:

```bash
# Look for domain-specific patterns in code
Grep "healthcare\|medical\|patient\|hipaa" --type=js,ts,py -i
Grep "finance\|payment\|transaction\|banking" --type=js,ts,py -i
Grep "ecommerce\|product\|cart\|order" --type=js,ts,py -i
Grep "education\|student\|course\|learning" --type=js,ts,py -i

# Check for compliance and security patterns
Grep "gdpr\|ccpa\|pci\|sox\|hipaa" --type=js,ts,py,md -i
Grep "audit\|compliance\|security\|encrypt" --type=js,ts,py -i

# Look for domain-specific data models
Grep "interface\|type.*{" --type=ts | head -20
Grep "class.*\|def.*\|function.*" --type=js,ts,py | head -20
```

### Domain Analysis Results
Document identified domain patterns (adapt based on detected domain):

```markdown
## Domain-Specific Context
- **Industry**: [Healthcare/Fintech/E-commerce/Education/SaaS/Enterprise/etc.]
- **Compliance Requirements**: [HIPAA/PCI-DSS/GDPR/SOX/CCPA/ISO27001/etc.]
- **Domain Entities**: [Patient/User/Product/Student/Customer/Employee/etc.]
- **Business Workflows**: [Care Management/Payment Processing/Order Fulfillment/Learning Management/etc.]
- **Data Sensitivity**: [PHI/PII/Financial/Educational Records/Customer Data/etc.]
```

## Step 4: Migration Pattern Analysis

Review the patterns that were successfully implemented during migration:

```bash
# Review successful PRPs created during migration (adapt to actual PRP names found)
LS "PRPs/" | grep -v "templates\|ai_docs\|migration" 
Read "PRPs/[first-major-feature].md"
Read "PRPs/[second-major-feature].md"

# Check pattern documentation created (adapt to actual structure)
LS "PRPs/ai_docs/patterns/"
Read "PRPs/ai_docs/patterns/[detected-pattern-type]_patterns.md"
LS "PRPs/ai_docs/workflows/"
Read "PRPs/ai_docs/workflows/[detected-workflow-type]_workflows.md"
Read "PRPs/ai_docs/integrations/external_services.md"

# Review validation reports for successful patterns
Read "PRPs/migration/phase2_completion_report.md"
Read "MIGRATION_PROGRESS_VALIDATION_REPORT.md"
```

### Successful Pattern Documentation
Extract proven patterns:

```markdown
## Proven Development Patterns

### Component Architecture
[Document actual component patterns used in project]

### State Management Approach
[Document actual state management patterns that worked]

### API Integration Patterns
[Document successful API integration approaches]

### Data Validation Patterns
[Document validation approaches that worked well]

### Testing Patterns
[Document testing approaches that were successful]
```

## Step 5: Team Workflow Integration Analysis

Analyze how context engineering actually integrated with team workflows:

```bash
# Check git history for PRP-related commits
git log --grep="PRP\|context" --oneline --since="3 months ago" | head -20

# Look for team adoption patterns
LS "PRPs/" | wc -l  # Count of PRPs created
LS "PRPs/migration/" | wc -l  # Count of migration-specific PRPs

# Check integration with existing tools
Read ".github/workflows/main.yml" || Read ".gitlab-ci.yml"
Read "CONTRIBUTING.md" || Read "DEVELOPMENT.md"
```

### Workflow Integration Results
Document actual integration:

```markdown
## Team Workflow Integration

### Development Process Integration
[How PRPs integrate with feature development]

### Code Review Integration  
[How context engineering fits into code reviews]

### Planning Integration
[How PRPs are used in sprint planning and feature design]

### Documentation Workflow
[How documentation is maintained and updated]
```

## Step 6: Create Final Project-Specific CLAUDE.md

Generate the comprehensive, customized CLAUDE.md:

```markdown

```

## Step 7: Implementation and Validation

Replace the existing CLAUDE.md with the project-specific version:

```bash
# Backup the current generic CLAUDE.md
cp CLAUDE.md CLAUDE_MIGRATION_TEMPLATE.md

# Create the new project-specific CLAUDE.md
# [Content created above based on actual project analysis]

# Validate the new CLAUDE.md works with existing PRPs
Read "PRPs/ai_care_assistant_enhancement.md"
# Verify compatibility with project-specific rules
```

### Final Validation Checklist
- [ ] Technology stack accurately reflects actual project
- [ ] Domain-specific rules match project requirements
- [ ] Proven patterns from migration are documented
- [ ] Team workflow integration reflects actual practices
- [ ] Quality standards match project needs
- [ ] Anti-patterns prevent actual issues encountered
- [ ] Success metrics reflect achieved results

## Expected Outcomes

After running this command, you should have:

1. **Accurate Technology Documentation**: CLAUDE.md reflects your actual Next.js + Firebase stack
2. **Healthcare-Specific Rules**: Proper HIPAA compliance and clinical workflow integration
3. **Proven Patterns**: Only patterns validated during your migration phases
4. **Team-Specific Integration**: Rules that match your actual development workflow
5. **Quality Standards**: Validation criteria based on your project's actual needs

The final CLAUDE.md becomes the definitive guide for all future context engineering work on your project, based on real migration experience rather than generic templates.

## Usage

Run this command after completing all migration phases (typically after Phase 4):

```bash
/finalize-project-context
```

This creates your permanent, project-specific CLAUDE.md that replaces the generic migration template and serves as the foundation for all future context engineering development on your project.
