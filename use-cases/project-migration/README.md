# Project Migration - Context Engineering Use Case

This use case demonstrates how to **migrate existing projects** to use Context Engineering principles through automated analysis, assessment, and structured implementation. Perfect for retrofitting legacy codebases with modern AI-assisted development practices.

> A PRP is PRD + curated codebase intelligence + agent/runbook—the minimum viable packet an AI needs to plausibly ship production-ready code on the first pass.

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Existing project (any technology stack)
- Git repository (recommended but not required)
- Access to project dependencies and documentation

### Step 1: Setup Migration Environment

```bash
# Clone the context engineering repository
git clone https://github.com/coleam00/Context-Engineering-Intro.git
cd Context-Engineering-Intro/use-cases/project-migration

# Copy migration template to your project directory
python copy_template.py /path/to/your-existing-project

# Navigate to your project
cd /path/to/your-existing-project

# The migration tools are now available in your project
```

**What copy_template.py does:**
- Copies all migration analysis tools to your existing project
- Creates `.claude/` directory with specialized migration commands
- Preserves your existing codebase completely unchanged
- Adds context engineering framework alongside your current structure

## 🎯 What You'll Learn

This use case teaches you how to:

- **Analyze existing codebases** systematically for context engineering opportunities
- **Extract knowledge and patterns** from legacy code and documentation
- **Create comprehensive context maps** of dependencies, architecture, and workflows
- **Generate PRPs from existing features** and technical debt
- **Implement gradual migration strategies** without disrupting current development

## 📋 Migration Process - From Legacy to Context Engineering

### Step 1: Project Discovery & Analysis

Run the comprehensive project analysis:

```bash
/analyze-existing-project
```

**What this does:**
- Scans your entire codebase structure and identifies technology stacks
- Analyzes package.json/requirements.txt/Cargo.toml for dependencies
- Discovers existing documentation (README, docs/, wiki content)
- Maps API integrations, databases, and external services
- Identifies test patterns and CI/CD configurations
- Generates initial assessment report in `MIGRATION_ANALYSIS.md`

### Step 2: Context Extraction & Knowledge Mapping

Extract existing knowledge into context engineering format:

```bash
/extract-project-context
```

**What this does:**
- Converts existing documentation to structured context format
- Identifies key functions, classes, and architectural patterns
- Maps complex business logic into potential PRPs
- Creates knowledge base in `PRPs/ai_docs/` directory
- Documents integration patterns and gotchas
- Generates technology-specific templates based on your stack

### Step 3: Generate Migration Strategy

Create a comprehensive migration roadmap:

```bash
/generate-migration-strategy MIGRATION_ANALYSIS.md
```

**What this does:**
- Analyzes project complexity and technical debt
- Prioritizes features and components for context engineering migration
- Creates phased implementation plan
- Generates PRPs for high-impact features first
- Documents integration points and dependencies
- Creates validation checkpoints for each migration phase

### Step 4: Execute Incremental Migration (4 Phases)

Implement context engineering gradually through 4 phases:

```bash
# Phase 1: Foundation and Proof of Concept (Weeks 1-2)
/execute-migration-phase PRPs/migration-strategy.md --phase=1

# Phase 2: Core Feature Migration (Weeks 3-4)
/execute-migration-phase PRPs/migration-strategy.md --phase=2

# Phase 3: Broad Feature Migration (Weeks 5-6)
/execute-migration-phase PRPs/migration-strategy.md --phase=3

# Phase 4: Optimization and Integration (Weeks 7-8)
/execute-migration-phase PRPs/migration-strategy.md --phase=4
```

**What each phase does:**
- **Phase 1**: Establishes infrastructure, creates 1-2 pilot PRPs, proves value
- **Phase 2**: Expands to 3-5 additional features, standardizes patterns
- **Phase 3**: Applies to majority of features, completes knowledge base
- **Phase 4**: Optimizes processes, integrates with team workflows

### Step 5: Validate After Each Phase

Ensure migration quality at each step:

```bash
/validate-migration-progress
```

**What this does:**
- Runs comprehensive validation on migrated components
- Compares before/after development velocity metrics
- Validates context accuracy and completeness
- Identifies areas needing additional context
- Generates adoption recommendations for team
- Creates reports in `PRPs/migration/validation-reports/`

### Step 6: Finalize Project Context (After All Phases)

Create your project-specific CLAUDE.md:

```bash
/finalize-project-context
```

**What this does:**
- Analyzes completed migration to extract proven patterns
- Detects actual technology stack and domain requirements
- Creates project-specific CLAUDE.md (replaces generic template)
- Documents team workflow integration and quality standards
- Establishes rules based on migration experience

### Step 7: Clean Up Migration Artifacts (Final Step)

Remove temporary migration files:

```bash
/cleanup-migration-artifacts
```

**What this does:**
- Verifies all phases are complete before proceeding
- Organizes validation reports and phase documentation
- Archives temporary migration files to `PRPs/migration/archive/`
- Leaves project in clean, production-ready state
- Creates cleanup completion report

- **Set success metrics** - Define how you'll measure migration effectiveness

### During Migration
- **Start small** - Begin with less critical features to learn the process
- **Involve the team** - Get input from developers who know the codebase best
- **Iterate quickly** - Use feedback to refine migration approach

### After Migration
- **Measure results** - Track development velocity and team satisfaction improvements
- **Share learnings** - Document what worked and what didn't for future migrations
- **Continuous improvement** - Refine context engineering practices based on usage
